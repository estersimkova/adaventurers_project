## 0. Project context and research questions 

This project was done in the context of the Applied Data Analysis course at EPFL given by professor Robert West. 
We were provided with the [Quotebank dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/4277311#.YbntzrvTWV4), containing newspaper quotes from 2015 to the beginning of 2020.

Using this dataset, our research questions were the following :

1. Are newspapersâ€™ quotes representative of events occurring in the world ? Meaning, can we deduce a time-line of important events that happened in the world during a certain time-frame only from topics emerging from newspaper quotes ?

2. When an important event occurs, does the general sentiment from quotes regarding the topic evolve ?

## 1. Hot Topics evolution over the years

### 1.1 Methodology: 
The Quotebank dataset provide more than a 100 millions quotes over x years. We decided to focus on the year 2015-2020, for each of these year we selected a maximum of 100'000 quotes each month. Then, we used the google model Bertopic to extract the topics (cite the bertopic) to extract the topics and associate each quote to a specific topic with a given probability. Using the most hot topics, meaning the ones that have the most quotes associated, we looked into the associated word and the most probable quotes. 


## 2. How a topic and the associated quotes can be associated to an event

### 2.1 Topics linked with an event

### 2.2 Timeline comparison


## 3. How an events can affect the general sentiments of the society towards a subject

### 3.1 cases 1

### 3.2 cases 2

### 3.3 cases 3
